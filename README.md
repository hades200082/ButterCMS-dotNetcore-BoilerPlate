# ButterCMS-dotNetcore-BoilerPlate
A boilerplate .Net core 2.0 MVC application for use with [ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com).

## Usage

1. Clone/fork this repo
2. Open the SLN file in Visual Studio 2017+
3. Configure the appSettings.json (and appSettings.*.json)
    - ButterCMS API Token goes in the `ApiKey` property.
    - `PrimaryAuthorSlug` is also required. This is usually defined as `<firstname>-<lastname>` from the relevant person's ButterCMS user account. It's also a good idea for the relevant user account to have a non-null "Profile Image URL" too since this is used within the layout.
4. Run the project
